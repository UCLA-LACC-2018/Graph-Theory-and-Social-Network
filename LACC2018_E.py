# matrix_load()
#
# Loads an adjacency matrix for a graph from a file
#
# input: none
# output: matrix containing each node 
# 
# Note: You can open a file using open(filename)
# 
# You can get a list containing each line with file.readlines()

# print_degrees(mat)
#
# Prints the degrees of all nodes in a graph given an adj. matrix 
#
# input: the adjacency matrix of the graph
# output: none
# 
# Note: You don't need to return anything. 
#
# Effectively, you'll need to count the number of 1s in each row 
# (or each column) and print this. Use a nested loop (for or while)

# Find the shortest path from node1 to node2 of all nodes in a graph given an adj. matrix

# input: the adjacency matrix of the graph,node1,node2
# output: 'The path is: ' appended with all edges on the path if there is one, otherwise print out 'No such path'
# Note: at the same time, return a list containing all the nodes on the path if there is one, otherwise return []
